# Open Civic Data Division Identifiers (OCD-ID)

The goal of this project is to assign somewhat predictable and globally unique identifiers to political divisions.

The canonical documentation of OCD-IDs is expressed as [OCDEP 2: Open Civic Data Divisions](https://open-civic-data.readthedocs.io/en/latest/proposals/0002.html).

Tests can be run with [Bazel](https://bazel.build/):

```
$ bazel test :all --test_output=errors
```
