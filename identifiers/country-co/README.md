New OCDIds for Colombia
Sur de Tolima, Urabá Antioquia, Raizal Community, and Foreign do not fall under Foreign (Colombian citizens residing abroad). They are separate contests. In particular Foreign falls under Deputies, as a Scope Special.
We are providing a summary that contrasts the previous division with our proposed one. Our main goal in making these adjustments is to enhance accuracy in the contests and ensure consistency with information from formal sources.

==============================
Sur de Tolima
==============================
Before: It was within the Deputies contest, all 16 Peace seats where together with National Scope
After:  We would like to keep this within the Deputies contest, but adjust the scope to “Special Scope” 
        and list each of the peace seats separately.

Raizal community

        both with Special Scope
